<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-py" data-lang="py"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl"><span class="s2">&#34;&#34;&#34;

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">9</span><span class="cl"><span class="s2">&#34;&#34;&#34;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>For this row, we need to find the number of trucks that are there between <code>2023-01-01 06:31:06</code> (1 minute prior to the <code>arrival_time</code> and <code>2023-01-01 06:34:48</code> (1 minute post the <code>departure_time</code>). Manually going through the original dataset, we see that <code>B3</code>, <code>C3</code>, <code>A6</code> and <code>A5</code> are the truck IDs that qualify - they all are at the station in a duration that is between <code>2023-01-01 06:31:06</code> and <code>2023-01-01 06:34:48</code>.</p>
<h2 id="visually-deriving-an-algorithm">Visually deriving an algorithm</h2>
<p>There are many cases that will qualify a truck to be present in the overlap window defined by a particular row. Specifically for the example above, we have (this visualization is generalizable, because for each row we can calculate without much difficulty the overlap <em>window</em> relative to the arrival and departure times):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/001_overlap_joins/overlap_algorithm.png" alt="The five different ways a period can overlap."></p>
<p>Take some time to absorb these cases - it&rsquo;s important for the part where we write the code for the solution. Note that we need to actually tell our algorithm to filter only for Cases 2, 3 and 4, since Cases 1 and 5 will not satisfy our requirements.</p>
<h2 id="writing-an-sql-query-based-on-the-algorithm">Writing an SQL query based on the algorithm</h2>
<p>In theory, we can use any language that has the capability to define rules that meet our algorithmic requirements outlined in the above section to find the solution. Why choose SQL? It&rsquo;s often able to convey elegantly the logic that was used to execute the algorithm; and while it does come with excessive verbosity at times, it doesn&rsquo;t quite in this case.</p>
<p>Note here that we run SQL in Python with almost no setup or boilerplate code - so this is a Python based solution as well (although not quite Pythonic!).</p>
<h3 id="introducing-the-duckdb-package">Introducing the DuckDB package</h3>
<p>Once again, in theory, any SQL package or language can be used. Far too few however meet the ease-of-use that <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> provides:</p>
<ol>
<li>no expensive set-up time (meaning no need for setting up databases, even temporary ones),</li>
<li>no dependencies (other than DuckDB itself, just <code>pip install duckdb</code>),</li>
<li>some very <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/05/04/friendlier-sql.html">friendly SQL extensions</a>, and</li>
<li>ability to work directly on Polars and Pandas DataFrames without conversions</li>
</ol>
<p>all with <a href="https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/">mind-blowing speed</a> that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Polars. We&rsquo;ll also use a few advanced SQL concepts noted below.</p>
<h4 id="self-joins">Self-joins</h4>
<p>This should be a familiar, albeit not often used concept - a join of a table with itself is a self join. There are few cases where such an operation would make sense, and this happens to be one of them.</p>
<h4 id="a-bullet-train-recap-of-non-equi-joins">A bullet train recap of non-equi joins</h4>
<p>A key concept that we&rsquo;ll use is the idea of joining on a <em>range</em> of values rather than a specific value. That is, instead of the usual <code>LEFT JOIN ON A.column = B.column</code>, we can do <code>LEFT JOIN ON A.column &lt;= B.column</code> for one row in table <code>A</code> to match to multiple rows in <code>B</code>. DuckDB has a <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/05/27/iejoin.html">blog post</a> that outlines this join in detail, including fast implementation.</p>
<h4 id="the-concept-of-list-columns">The concept of <code>LIST</code> columns</h4>
<p>DuckDB has first class support for <code>LIST</code> columns - that is, each row in a <code>LIST</code> column can have a varying length (much like a Python <code>list</code>), but must have the exact same datatype (like R&rsquo;s <code>vector</code>). Using list columns allow us to eschew the use of an additional <code>GROUP BY</code> operation on top of a <code>WHERE</code> filter or <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> operation, since we can directly perform those on the <code>LIST</code> column itself.</p>
<h4 id="date-algebra">Date algebra</h4>
<p>Dates can be rather difficult to handle well in most tools and languages, with several packages purpose built to make handling them easier - <a href="https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/">lubridate</a> from the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> is a stellar example. Thankfully, DuckDB provides a similar swiss-knife set of tools to deal with it, including specifying <code>INTERVAL</code>s (a special data type that represent a period of time independent of specific time values) to modify <code>TIMESTAMP</code> values using addition or subtraction.</p>
<h3 id="tell-me-the-query-please">Tell me the query, PLEASE!</h3>
<p>Okay - had a lot of background. Let&rsquo;s have at it! The query by itself in SQL is (see immediately below for runnable code in Python):</p>

We also find how DuckDB is able to seamlessly integrate with an existing Pandas or Polars pipeline with zero-conversion costs. In fact, we can convert this back to a Polars or Pandas dataframe by appending the ending bracket with <code>db.query(...).pl()</code> and <code>db.query(...).pd()</code> respectively.</p>

<h3 id="simplification-part-2">Simplification: Part 2</h3>
<p>I think the SQL query in the above section is very easy to ready already. However, it is a little clunky overall, and there is a way that we can leverage DuckDB&rsquo;s extensive optimizations to simplify our <strong>legibility</strong> by rewriting the query as a cross join:</p>

<p>So in effect, we&rsquo;re actually exploiting a feature of DuckDB to allow us to write our queries in a suboptimal manner for greater readability, and allowing the optmizer to do a good chunk of our work for us. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend using this generally, because not all SQL engine optmizers will be able to find an efficient route to these calculations for large datasets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad you asked. Here&rsquo;s the DuckDB <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/meta/explain.html">page explaining <code>EXPLAIN</code></a> (heh). Here&rsquo;s the code I used:</p>

<h2 id="the-datatable-way">The <code>data.table</code> way</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table"><code>data.table</code></a> is a package that has historically been ahead of its time - in both speed and features that it has had. Developement has taken a hit recently, but will likely <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5656">pick back up</a>. It&rsquo;s my favourite package on all fronts for data manipulation, but suffers simply from the lack of broader R support across the ML and DL space.</p>
<h3 id="the-foverlaps-function">The <code>foverlaps</code> function</h3>
<p>If this kind of overlapping join is common, shouldn&rsquo;t someone have developed a package for it? Turns out, <code>data.table</code> has, and with very specific constraints that make it the perfect solution to our problem (if you don&rsquo;t mind switching over to R, that is).</p>
<p>The <code>foverlaps</code> function has these requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The input <code>data.table</code> objects have to be keyed for automatic recognition of columns.</li>
<li>The default match type is that it matches all three cases from the image above. Side note: it also has matches for <code>within</code> overlap, matching <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> windows,</li>
<li>The last two matching columns in the join condition in <code>by</code> must specify the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> points of the overlapping window. This isn&rsquo;t a problem for us now, but does restrict for future uses where we may want non-equi joins on other cases.</li>
</ol>

<p>The package offers a wonderful, nearly one-stop solution that doesn&rsquo;t require you to write the logic out for the query or command yourself, but has a major problem for a lot of users - it requires you to switch your codebase to R, and a lot of your tasks may be on Python or in an SQL pipeline. So, what do you do?</p>
<p>Consider the effort in maintaining an additional dependency for your analytics pipeline (i.e. R), and the effort that you&rsquo;ll need to invest to run R from Python, or run an R script in your pipeline and pull the output from it back into the pipeline, and make your call.</p>
