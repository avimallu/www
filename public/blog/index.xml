<p>I needed to use a codebase that had a mix of light <code>numpy</code> operations, coupled with a few heavy mathematical optimization problems that did not use <code>numpy</code>.
The API that I had access to provided to be too slow (even asynchronously), so I thought I&rsquo;ll run this locally on a faster system in parallel to speed
things up. Turns out, that was easier said than done, and I picked up the importance of environment variables along the way.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that the &ldquo;black box&rdquo; code looked something like this.</p>

<li>The most important bit: <code>numpy</code> was used sparingly, and the compute intensive part was in the optimization tools.</li>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>I needed to call this script multiple times, supplying different arguments each time. A single call doesn&rsquo;t take much time on my system:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An experienced programmer at this point would likely scream one of two words: CONTENTION! OVERSUBSCRIPTION!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore what that means.</p>
<h2 id="but-why">But why?</h2>
<p><code>numpy</code> is a very optimized package. It tries to use all cores available under the hood so that it can do what you asked
in the fastest possible time. This is a great idea when you have large matrices to operate on.</p>
<p>However, we called <code>numpy</code> via Python here 10 separate times. Each of those 10 processes were trying to access 32 threads
on the machine. 320 threads on 32 cores, which means that there were significantly more threads than cores, all actively
vying for those 32 cores!</p>
<p>The clearest signal of this is that a <em>naive attempt at parallelization via multiprocessing</em> being <strong>SLOWER</strong> than a
sequential set of calls to the same operation. That&rsquo;s why using a system with more cores and trying to parallelize blindly
doesn&rsquo;t always speed things up, and in the worst case, such as this, it considerably slows things down.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<p><code>numpy</code> uses different libraries for multithreading based on the system. Environment variables can be used to control the
number of threads each process creates, a summary of which is provided below.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th style="text-align: center">Variable</th>
          <th style="text-align: center">Backend</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center"><code>OMP_NUM_THREADS</code></td>
          <td style="text-align: center">OpenMP (used by many BLAS)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center"><code>OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS</code></td>
          <td style="text-align: center">OpenBLAS</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center"><code>MKL_NUM_THREADS</code></td>
          <td style="text-align: center">Intel MKL</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center"><code>BLIS_NUM_THREADS</code></td>
          <td style="text-align: center">BLIS</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center"><code>VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS</code></td>
          <td style="text-align: center">Apple Accelerate</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>To avoid oversubscription, we need to tell <code>numpy</code> to use fewer threads than the default (which is all threads), because
(1) we are aware that the process running is not compute intensive, and (2) we will handle parallelism ourselves.</p>
<p>On my system, I was using OpenMP, so all that I needed to do was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real world impact in the actual codebase was 15x response time, and 30x throughput. What used to take 120 machines earlier took only 4 now!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ending-notes">Ending notes</h2>
<p>Why did this work here? Let&rsquo;s revisit the &ldquo;most important&rdquo; bit of information from the demonstration code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important bit: <code>numpy</code> was used sparingly, and the compute intensive part was in the optimization tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This technique of using environment variables to restrict the number of threads that a process can spawn, and then
running it in parallel (via <code>parallel</code> based multiprocessing) will work in any case where multiple processes are
spawned for each physical core, and you want to maximize throughput. In case the computations used by <code>numpy</code> are
more compute intensive, you could experiment with allowing more threads while still paralllelizing:</p>





<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">seq <span class="m">10</span> <span class="p">|</span> parallel -j8 <span class="s1">&#39;OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 python test.py {}&#39;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This allows use of up to 4 threads, while spawning 8 processes in parallel, and in theory still using a total of 32 cores.
You may need to adjust this to find out what works best for your system.</p>
<p>In addition, to make this work less dependent on the libraries that <code>numpy</code> can use, just set more (or all) of the
environment variables:</p>





<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">seq <span class="m">10</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="se">\
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl"><span class="se"></span>parallel -j32 <span class="s2">&#34;OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 \
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl"><span class="s2">OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 \
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl"><span class="s2">MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 \
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">5</span><span class="cl"><span class="s2">python test.py {}&#34;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>An interesting side note is that the parallel, but single core run took 0.61 seconds, <strong>less</strong> than the time it took to run
a single call to the script on multiple cores (via threading in <code>numpy</code> internally). For large matrices, this also indicates
that the overhead associated with spawning 32 threads for the single task might actually be significant - and running on a
single core might just be inherently better!</p>
<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve simplified a few things in this blog post:</p>
<ol>
<li>This demo uses heavy <code>numpy</code> ops to clearly show the oversubscription effect. The actual codebase had much lighter
usage, but the principle is the same.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve used <em>contention</em> and <em>oversubscription</em> interchangeably here. The former is a case of threads competing for
the same shared resource, and the latter is a higher thread count than CPU cores. <em>Oversubscription</em> here <strong>led</strong> to <em>contention</em>.</li>
<li>Modern systems have hundreds, or thousands of active threads for very few system cores. The difference with most of
these threads is that they often are &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo;, and don&rsquo;t <em>vie</em> for attention like the <code>numpy</code> ones.</li>

<p>When I worked in healthcare consulting, I often spent a LOT of my time creating PowerPoint presentations (<em>decks</em> in consulting lingo - not even <em>slide decks</em>). However, it was rather repetitive. Thus, was born PowerPointSnap.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write this down as pointers.</p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s a VBA based PowerPoint add-on. Just a set of commands that work well with each other.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s Windows only - it&rsquo;s unlikely to work on MacOS.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s installation-free and is not an executable, which makes it perfect for locked-down corporate environments, as long as you have the permission to download files.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="how-do-i-get-it">How do I get it?</h1>
<p>The project is available on this <a href="https://github.com/avimallu/PowerPointSnap">Github repo</a>. The instructions to install it are available there, but here&rsquo;s the down-low:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the Snap.ppam file to your system.</li>
<li>Enable the developer options.</li>
<li>Go to the Developer tab, and click on PowerPoint Add-ins.</li>
<li>Click on Add New. Choose the location of the file you just dowloaded. Click Close.</li>
<li>To uninstall, repeat the process, and simply click on Remove this time.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="what-can-i-do-with-it">What can I do with it?</h1>
<p>Frankly, a LOT. The base concept of this tool is:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Set&rdquo; a shape as the one you want to copy a property from.</li>
<li>Select any property from the list to automatically apply it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a non-exhaustive list of all the options available.</p>
<h2 id="apply-properties-of-shapes-directly">Apply properties of shapes directly</h2>
<p>This is the part of the interface that can be used for shapes (which include charts and tables).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/003_powerpointsnap/01_Shapes.png" alt="The UI for copying shape properties"></p>
<p>To use, first select a <em>shape</em> object, click on &ldquo;Set&rdquo;. Then, choose the object you want to <em>Snap</em> its properties to (see how I got the inspiration for the name?). You should be able to copy all compatible properties - if something is not copy-able, the tool will show an error, and then let you exit.</p>
<p>Note that it&rsquo;s probably not to apply a property of a shape to a table - if you want to make the entire table orange, there are probably better built-in ways to do it than to use <em>Snap</em>.</p>
<h2 id="beautify-charts-with-snappable-properties">Beautify charts with <em>Snap</em>pable properties</h2>
<p>Charts are also supported, with dedicated features for it.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/003_powerpointsnap/02_Charts.png" alt="The UI for copying chart properties"></p>
<p>What do these features do? You should be able to hover over the option and get a tooltip that shows what it&rsquo;s capable of, but here&rsquo;s another summary just in case:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sync Value/Date Axis: this will try to align the range, the ticks, the numeric values etc. of the &ldquo;set&rdquo; chart to the one you&rsquo;ve selected. I couldn&rsquo;t put in just $x$ and $y$ here because Microsoft internally doesn&rsquo;t label them that way. Try either of these two options (you can undo!) and see what works best for your chart. This doesn&rsquo;t work well yet for 3D charts.</li>
<li>Sync Plot/Title/Legend: often, you want to centre a title, or make sure that multiple charts that show nearly identical things for different variables all <em>look</em> exactly the same from a client perspective. But that&rsquo;s usually difficult if you&rsquo;ve already configured the charts a little - which can be remedied with this option!</li>
<li>Format Painter: this is simply a helper for the normal format painter to align the formats of the text that you&rsquo;ve selected with the way it originally is in the &ldquo;set&rdquo; chart. The reason for this feature is simply to avoid going back to <em>Home</em> to click on the <em>Format Painter</em> option again.</li>
<li>Reset Axes Scales: in case you messed up somewhere, you can use this to rever to PowerPoint defaults.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next two options deserve their own section.</p>
<h2 id="customize-the-labels-programmatically">Customize the labels programmatically</h2>
<p>Your immediate senior in a consulting environment would frown at your chart, and then exclaim, &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s too many labels for the data points. Can you show them every two/three/four labels? I know this is manual work, but it&rsquo;s a one time thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <strong>never</strong> a one time affair. But don&rsquo;t worry, we have this nice feature to help us. If you click on the <em>Customize Label</em> option, you will get this (without the &ldquo;Set&rdquo; option):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/003_powerpointsnap/DataLabelsScreenshot.JPG" alt="The UI for customizing labels."></p>
<p>Never mind the rather unfriendly legend entries. They&rsquo;re just here to demonstrate that you can do the following kinds of whacky abilities with your own chart!</p>
<h3 id="screenshots-of-the-chart-snapability">Screenshots of the chart <em>snap</em>ability</h3>
<p>Of course, visuals will do it more justice. For example, look at this image:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/003_powerpointsnap/Revenue_Presentation_1.png" alt="There’s a lot wrong with this image. But primarily, the charts are of different sizes, the axes are different, the labels are too clustered, and the titles aren’t centered."></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the left chart. Press &ldquo;Set&rdquo; in the toolbar for <em>Snap</em>.</li>
<li>Click on the right chart, and then go through the following:
<ol>
<li>In <em>Shapes</em>, click on <em>Dim</em>. This will align the shapes of the chart.</li>
<li>Use the guides that you get while moving the chart to align the positions of the two charts now that their shapes are equal.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll notice that the chart area doesn&rsquo;t still match, nor does the title.</li>
<li>In <em>Charts</em>, click on <em>Sync Plot Area</em> and <em>Sync Title Area</em>, and watch the magic unfold.</li>
<li>Now, click on the second chart, and click on &ldquo;Set&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s align the axes of the first chart to the second one.</li>
<li>Click on the first chart, and then in <em>Charts</em>, click <em>Sync Value Axis</em>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s bring that senior&rsquo;s exclamation back into play - (s)he wants you to highlight <em>only</em> Profit labels, and that too every 2 iterations. To do this:
<ol>
<li>Click on <em>Customize Labels</em> after clicking on either chart.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll get the screen shown in the previous section. Make sure to adjust the values such that it&rsquo;s exactly like the screenshot there.</li>
<li>Click on &ldquo;Save and Run&rdquo;. This will <em>save</em> the configuration you&rsquo;ve selected, and <em>run</em> it on the chart you&rsquo;ve selected.</li>
<li>Click the other chart. Then, in <em>Charts</em>, click on <em>Rerun Customization</em>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what your results should look like:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/003_powerpointsnap/Revenue_Presentation_2.png" alt="Everything almost consistent. Your senior rests their eyes, and secretly wonder how you managed to do it quickly… maybe they should change some requirements…"></p>
<p>Of course, getting those calculations right is a whole different thing that will need some work.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, you have two tables that show similar values&hellip; you know the drill. Here&rsquo;s what you can do in a scenario such as this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/003_powerpointsnap/Table_Presentation_1.png" alt="Similar data, but vastly different tables."></p>
<p>This is what the <em>Tables</em> section of the tool looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/003_powerpointsnap/03_Tables.png" alt="The UI for Tables"></p>
<p>To align these tables together,</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the left table. Press &ldquo;Set&rdquo; in the toolbar for <em>Snap</em>.</li>
<li>Click on the right table.</li>
<li>Click on <em>Shapes</em>, inside it, <em>Dim</em>. Now the shapes of the table are the same.</li>
<li>In <em>Tables</em>, click on <em>Sync Column Widths</em>. Now the columns are also the same.</li>
<li>If you try to align by rows, it fails because the number of rows are not the same in the two tables.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll end up with:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/003_powerpointsnap/Table_Presentation_2.png" alt="Similar data, and similar enough tables."></p>
<p>Pretty neat, eh?</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="premise">Premise</h1>
<p>In this day and age, we&rsquo;re not short on data. <em>Good</em> data, on the other hand, is very valuable. When you&rsquo;ve got a large amount of improperly labelled data, it may become hard to find to find a representative dataset to train a model on such that it generalizes well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s formalize the problem a little so that a proper approach can be developed. Here&rsquo;s the problem statement:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have a large-ish set of (imperfectly) labelled data points. These data points can be represented as a 2D matrix.</li>
<li>You need to train a model to classify these data points on either these labels, or on labels dervied from imperfect labels.</li>
<li>You need a good (but not perfect) representative sample for the model to be generalizable, but there are too many data points for each label to manually pick representative examples.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="in-a-hurry">In a hurry?</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the premise and see if it fits your problem.</li>
<li>Go to the <strong>For the folks in a hurry!</strong> section at the end to find the generic solution and how it works.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-representative-samples">Why do we need representative samples?</h2>
<p>Generally, three things come to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allows the model to be generalizable for all <em>kinds</em> of data points <em>within</em> a category.</li>
<li>Allows for faster training of the model - you need <em>fewer</em> data points to get the same accuracy!</li>
<li>Allows maintaining the training set - if your training set needs validation by experts or annotations, this keeps your costs low!</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="define-the-data">Define the data</h1>
<p>This data can be practically anything that can be represented as a 2D matrix.</p>
<p>There are exceptions. Raw image data (as numbers) might get difficult because even if you flatten them, they&rsquo;ll be significant correlation between features. For example, a face can appear practically anywhere in the image, and all pixels centered around the face will be highly correlated, even if they are on different lines. A workaround in this case would be to pipe the image through a CNN model that has been trained on some <em>generic</em> task and produces a 1D representation of a single image in the final hidden layer before the output. Other data will need further processing along similar lines.</p>
<h2 id="get-a-specific-dataset">Get a specific dataset</h2>
<p>For this specific article, I will use the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakritidis/product-classification-and-categorization/data">ShopMania dataset on Kaggle</a>. I apologize in advance for not using a more easily accessible dataset (you need to sign into Kaggle to download it) - and I&rsquo;m not 100% sure if the GPL allows me to create a copy of the data and place it in my own repository. Nevertheless, the data (if you download it and choose to use it instead of some other dataset) will look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: whenever I want to show an output <em>along</em> with the code I used for it, you&rsquo;ll see the characters <code>&gt;&gt;</code> indicating the command used, and the output to be without those prefixes.</p>

Each product is categorized into this tree structure by being mapped to only one leaf category. Some of these 191 leaf categories contain millions of products.

<p>Okay - so now we have exactly 10,000 products <em>per</em> category. We only have the title of the product that can be leveraged for categorization. So let me define the task this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Craft a <em>small</em> representative sample for each category.</p>

<p>Why small? It helps that it&rsquo;ll make the model faster to train - <em>and</em> keep the training data manageable in size.</p>
<h1 id="finding-representative-samples">Finding representative samples</h1>
<p>I mentioned earlier that we need to represent data as a 2D matrix for the technique I have in mind to work. How can I translate a list of text to a matrix? The answer&rsquo;s rather simple: use <code>SentenceTransformers</code> to get a string&rsquo;s embedding. You could also use more classic techniques like computing TF-IDF values, or use more advanced transformers, but I&rsquo;ve noticed that <code>SentenceTransformers</code> are able to capture semantic meaning of sentences rather well (assuming you use a good model suited for the language the data is in) - they are trained on sentence similarity after all.</p>
<h2 id="getting-sentencetransformer-embeddings">Getting <code>SentenceTransformer</code> embeddings</h2>

There are faster approaches, but they are slightly more involved than would be beneficial for a blog post. The wait will be worth it, I promise! In addition, the call to <code>.numpy()</code> at the end is to directly get a single <code>numpy</code> array - otherwise you get a <code>list</code> of <code>numpy</code> arrays, which is rather inefficient. Further, <code>SentenceTransformers</code> will try to run on the GPU if available, and if so, you will need to write <code>.cpu().numpy()</code> so that the tensor is copied from the GPU to the CPU.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: for a proof-of-concept implementation, or if you&rsquo;re on the CPU, try the <code>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code> model. It&rsquo;s a much smaller and much faster model, although you sacrifice a little in terms of accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="the-concept-of-_approximate_-nearest-neighbors">The concept of <em>approximate</em> nearest neighbors</h2>
<p>Performing any kind of nearest neighbor algorithm on medium scale datasets (even bordering 10,000 rows and tens of columns) tends to be slow. A primary driver of this was the need to calculate all, or nearly all distances between all data points. <em>Approximate</em> nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms work around this through various approaches, which warrant their own blog post. For now, it would suffice to understand that there are shortcuts that ANN algorithms take to give you if not the exact nearest neighbor, at least <em>one</em> of the nearest neighbors (hence the term <em>approximate</em>).</p>
<p>There are several algorithms that you can use - I shall proceed with <code>faiss</code>, because it has a nice Python interface and is rather easy to work with. You can use any algorithm - a full list of the major ones are <a href="https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks">available here</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain why we&rsquo;re in the nearest neighbor territory in due course.</p>

<p>To proceed with getting a representative sample, the next step is to find the nearest neighbors for <strong>all</strong> data points in the database. This isn&rsquo;t too hard - <code>faiss</code> <code>index</code> objects have a built-in <code>search</code> method to find the <code>k</code> nearest neighbors for a given index, along with the (approximate) distance to it. Let&rsquo;s then write a function to get the following information: the label index for whom nearest neighbors are being searched, the indices of said nearest neighbors and the distance between them. In network graph parlance, this kind of data is called an <em>edge list</em> i.e. a list of pair of <em>nodes</em> that are connected, along with any additional information that specifies a property (in this case distance) of the <em>edge</em> that connects these <em>nodes</em>.</p>

<p>The next step in the process is to create a network graph using the edge-list. But why?</p>
<p>Remember that we have identified the (k=5) nearest neighbors of <strong>each</strong> data point. Let&rsquo;s say that we have a point A that has a nearest neighbor B. C is <strong>not</strong> a nearest neighbor of A, but it is a nearest neighbor of B. In a network graph, if A and C are sufficiently similar enough to B within a particular <em>minimum thershold</em>, then A will be connected to C through B! Hopefully a small visual below would help.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/002_representative_samples/001_Network_Cluster_1.png" alt="How a network component is formed."></p>
<p>What happens when such a concept is extended for many data points? Not all of them would be connected - because we&rsquo;re applying a <em>minimum</em> threshold that they have to meet. This is the only hueristic part of the rather fast process. Here&rsquo;s one more helpful visual:</p>

<p>If you want to write down an algorithmic way of looking at this approach,</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain a 2D representation of the labelled/categorized data. This can be embeddings for strings, the final hidden state output from a generic CNN model for images, or a good ol&rsquo; tabular dataset where all numbers are normalized and can be expressed as such.</li>
<li>Create an ANN database (based on a package such as <code>faiss</code>) that allows you fast nearest neighbor searches. Use cosine similarity for an easy threshold determination step.</li>
<li>Obtain an edge-list of k (from 5 to 100) nearest neighbors for <strong>all</strong> (or a sample of data points in case your dataset is incredibly HUGE) data points in the ANN database.</li>
<li>Apply a minimum threshold on similarity (completely based on heuristics), and obtain the connected components of the network graph from the filtered edge-list you just created.</li>
<li>Map all indices back to their source data-points that make sense, and pick any number of items from each cluster (usually, I end up picking one element from each cluster), and you now have your representative sample!</li>

Manually going through the original dataset, we see that <code>B3</code>, <code>C3</code>, <code>A6</code> and <code>A5</code> are the truck IDs that qualify - they all are at the station in a duration that is between <code>2023-01-01 06:31:06</code> and <code>2023-01-01 06:34:48</code>.</p>
<h2 id="visually-deriving-an-algorithm">Visually deriving an algorithm</h2>
<p>There are many cases that will qualify a truck to be present in the overlap window defined by a particular row. Specifically for the example above, we have (this visualization is generalizable, because for each row we can calculate without much difficulty the overlap <em>window</em> relative to the arrival and departure times):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/001_overlap_joins/overlap_algorithm.png" alt="The five different ways a period can overlap."></p>
<p>Take some time to absorb these cases - it&rsquo;s important for the part where we write the code for the solution. Note that we need to actually tell our algorithm to filter only for Cases 2, 3 and 4, since Cases 1 and 5 will not satisfy our requirements.</p>
<h2 id="writing-an-sql-query-based-on-the-algorithm">Writing an SQL query based on the algorithm</h2>
<p>In theory, we can use any language that has the capability to define rules that meet our algorithmic requirements outlined in the above section to find the solution. Why choose SQL? It&rsquo;s often able to convey elegantly the logic that was used to execute the algorithm; and while it does come with excessive verbosity at times, it doesn&rsquo;t quite in this case.</p>
<p>Note here that we run SQL in Python with almost no setup or boilerplate code - so this is a Python based solution as well (although not quite Pythonic!).</p>
<h3 id="introducing-the-duckdb-package">Introducing the DuckDB package</h3>
<p>Once again, in theory, any SQL package or language can be used. Far too few however meet the ease-of-use that <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> provides:</p>
<ol>
<li>no expensive set-up time (meaning no need for setting up databases, even temporary ones),</li>
<li>no dependencies (other than DuckDB itself, just <code>pip install duckdb</code>),</li>
<li>some very <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/05/04/friendlier-sql.html">friendly SQL extensions</a>, and</li>
<li>ability to work directly on Polars and Pandas DataFrames without conversions</li>
</ol>
<p>all with <a href="https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/">mind-blowing speed</a> that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Polars. We&rsquo;ll also use a few advanced SQL concepts noted below.</p>
<h4 id="self-joins">Self-joins</h4>
<p>This should be a familiar, albeit not often used concept - a join of a table with itself is a self join. There are few cases where such an operation would make sense, and this happens to be one of them.</p>
<h4 id="a-bullet-train-recap-of-non-equi-joins">A bullet train recap of non-equi joins</h4>
<p>A key concept that we&rsquo;ll use is the idea of joining on a <em>range</em> of values rather than a specific value. That is, instead of the usual <code>LEFT JOIN ON A.column = B.column</code>, we can do <code>LEFT JOIN ON A.column &lt;= B.column</code> for one row in table <code>A</code> to match to multiple rows in <code>B</code>. DuckDB has a <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/05/27/iejoin.html">blog post</a> that outlines this join in detail, including fast implementation.</p>
<h4 id="the-concept-of-list-columns">The concept of <code>LIST</code> columns</h4>
<p>DuckDB has first class support for <code>LIST</code> columns - that is, each row in a <code>LIST</code> column can have a varying length (much like a Python <code>list</code>), but must have the exact same datatype (like R&rsquo;s <code>vector</code>). Using list columns allow us to eschew the use of an additional <code>GROUP BY</code> operation on top of a <code>WHERE</code> filter or <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> operation, since we can directly perform those on the <code>LIST</code> column itself.</p>
<h4 id="date-algebra">Date algebra</h4>
<p>Dates can be rather difficult to handle well in most tools and languages, with several packages purpose built to make handling them easier - <a href="https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/">lubridate</a> from the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> is a stellar example. Thankfully, DuckDB provides a similar swiss-knife set of tools to deal with it, including specifying <code>INTERVAL</code>s (a special data type that represent a period of time independent of specific time values) to modify <code>TIMESTAMP</code> values using addition or subtraction.</p>
<h3 id="tell-me-the-query-please">Tell me the query, PLEASE!</h3>
<p>Okay - had a lot of background. Let&rsquo;s have at it! The query by itself in SQL is (see immediately below for runnable code in Python):</p>

We also find how DuckDB is able to seamlessly integrate with an existing Pandas or Polars pipeline with zero-conversion costs. In fact, we can convert this back to a Polars or Pandas dataframe by appending the ending bracket with <code>db.query(...).pl()</code> and <code>db.query(...).pd()</code> respectively.</p>

<p>So in effect, we&rsquo;re actually exploiting a feature of DuckDB to allow us to write our queries in a suboptimal manner for greater readability, and allowing the optmizer to do a good chunk of our work for us. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend using this generally, because not all SQL engine optmizers will be able to find an efficient route to these calculations for large datasets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad you asked. Here&rsquo;s the DuckDB <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/meta/explain.html">page explaining <code>EXPLAIN</code></a> (heh). Here&rsquo;s the code I used:</p>

<h2 id="the-datatable-way">The <code>data.table</code> way</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table"><code>data.table</code></a> is a package that has historically been ahead of its time - in both speed and features that it has had. Developement has taken a hit recently, but will likely <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5656">pick back up</a>. It&rsquo;s my favourite package on all fronts for data manipulation, but suffers simply from the lack of broader R support across the ML and DL space.</p>
<h3 id="the-foverlaps-function">The <code>foverlaps</code> function</h3>
<p>If this kind of overlapping join is common, shouldn&rsquo;t someone have developed a package for it? Turns out, <code>data.table</code> has, and with very specific constraints that make it the perfect solution to our problem (if you don&rsquo;t mind switching over to R, that is).</p>
<p>The <code>foverlaps</code> function has these requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The input <code>data.table</code> objects have to be keyed for automatic recognition of columns.</li>
<li>The default match type is that it matches all three cases from the image above. Side note: it also has matches for <code>within</code> overlap, matching <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> windows,</li>
<li>The last two matching columns in the join condition in <code>by</code> must specify the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> points of the overlapping window. This isn&rsquo;t a problem for us now, but does restrict for future uses where we may want non-equi joins on other cases.</li>
</ol>

<p>The package offers a wonderful, nearly one-stop solution that doesn&rsquo;t require you to write the logic out for the query or command yourself, but has a major problem for a lot of users - it requires you to switch your codebase to R, and a lot of your tasks may be on Python or in an SQL pipeline. So, what do you do?</p>
<p>Consider the effort in maintaining an additional dependency for your analytics pipeline (i.e. R), and the effort that you&rsquo;ll need to invest to run R from Python, or run an R script in your pipeline and pull the output from it back into the pipeline, and make your call.</p>
